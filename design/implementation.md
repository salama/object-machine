# Design and Implementation

Object orientation has been around for so long, today many people learn it as their first
computer language. This is a good thing, as object orientation makes the task of programming
a computer more understandable.
But while the concepts of object orientation are firmly established, implementations still
elude most people as complicated, cryptic, almost a black art.

So the main goal is to clarify how an object oriented language is implemented. And since
object orientation is the best way to describe such an effort we will use that.
As we will see this is not the first time this has been attempted, but we will also see how
previous attempts fall short of this goal.

And to prove that the design is workable, viable in a way, we will show how the design is
mapped to current hardware. We will need a good object oriented abstraction of current hardware
to do this.
